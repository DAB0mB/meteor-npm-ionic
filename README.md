# meteor-npm-ionic

This package was originally created for [angular-meteor-whatsapp](https://github.com/DAB0mB/angular-meteor-whatsapp) and solves the limitation of requiring ionic components without spoiling the dependency tree.

## Installation

First require the assets:

```
meteor add dab0mb:ionic-assets
```

And then add the scripts:

```
meteor npm install ionic-scripts
```

## Usage

```js
import 'ionic-scripts';
```
